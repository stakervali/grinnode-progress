| 12.11.2020 | stakervali | 2 | I checked example log file and make a quick filtering for target lines. I cloned frontend and backend source code. I will work on python parser for regex and develop a log file generator for testing parser. I also cloned and skim through frontend code | Parser and mobile friendly frontend | I could not start up backend application due to database connection problems. I will leave it as it is now, parser will be tested on synthetic data | Yes |
| 14.11.2020 | stakervali| 5 | I have coded a scraper which extracts collected reorg lines from grinnode.live server. This logs will be used in data generator. I researched on regular expressions and started coding of parser. I will tokenize different parts of the line for date, blockhash etc and extract data| tokenization of reorg line is not finished | ----| Yes |
| 16.11.2020 | stakervali| 5 | I finished line parser which uses regular expressions to extract proper segments of line. I tested parser in scrapped log files and inspected results. It worked without any errors. | I will work on parser for running on different files in the folder structure and write results to database. Also I need to code a sample data generator for testing.  | ----| Yes |
| 18.11.2020 | stakervali  | 3 | I developed table script  for reorg_lines in database and code for inserting parsed line information to database.

| 20.11.2020 | stakervali  | 5| I created a sample data generator script which creates file with desired reorg line ratio in a defined timespan in real time. | I will convert parser into a system script and test it in real-time  | ---- | Yes |
| 24.11.2020 | stakervali  | 4| I have worked on creating a manager which generates files for different nodes using threading.   | I will continue work on converting parser into a system script and testing it in real-time  | ---- | Yes |
| 25.11.2020 | stakervali  | 5| I have finished sample data manager. It creates a thread for each node and use that thread for creating a log file for a given number of lines and lines per file. | I will work on running parser in directory tree and process each log file.   | ---- | Yes |
| 26.11.2020 | stakervali | 5 |I created a sample directory with 5 nodes creating log and tested parser. I fixed a bug on parser caused by miliseconds on date strings with regex. I have modified data generator and parser to work on .gz archive files. Also worked on parsing algorithm to avoid possible duplicates on archive and plain files | Finalize and test parser on production | --- | Yes |
| 27.11.2020| stakervali | 6 | I developed parser to work with infinite loop and parse only modified files.

|12.12.2020| stakervali| 3| I have worked on accessing coingecko api for health status. I acquired anomaly data and price from exchange via python script. I added price and change data to status bar in frontend. I examined based on davidtavarez's grinaddresschecker repo code to implement in frontend. Could not validate my wallet on his site for testing | I will test and deploy reorg parser to production and add health status from coingecko and grin address checker. |CoinGecko api presents anomaly and trust score per each exchange, some gives green, some gives yellow. Need to decide how to process this data in order to obtain health status. I could not have progress on address checker, need to learn more about owner and foreign api | Yes| 
|19.12.2020| stakervali| 4| I have added random grin art shown in contact page fix a bug on grinnode live page and make updates to news. I explained reorg parser towarmbeer  | I will work on grin health check api  | --- | No| 
|21.12.2020| stakervali |4 | I have examined github repos of  j01tz  and  bladedoyle for nicehash api usage with respect to grin health check. I have created script for accessing parameters such as average_price and speed | I will continue implementing algorithm based on rules gin j01tz grin-health repo. |---- |No |

I converted challenges to submenu as decided | I will continue implementing algorithm based on rules gin j01tz grin-health repo. | Challenges item in topbar is not highlighted when navigated. Also I have not be able to convert challenges to submenu in sidebar navigation drawer despite trying. The icon placement was problematic.    |No |
|14.01.2021| stakervali | 2 | I have added a new FAQ item, added new art from grinsun to contact page and recalibrated countdown timer to remaining block count| I will update the news section and implement other changes requested by @MCM-Mike | ---- |No |
|15.01.2021| stakervali | 3 | I have found out that countdown timer shows different values depending on client timerzone. I have changed code so that in every 30 seconds, countdown is readjusted to remaining block count. I have updated news section. Added blockheight to stats page and removed API V1 links from tutorials section| I will work on implementing algorithm based on rules in j01tz grin-health repo. | ---- |No |
|22.01.2021| stakervali | 4 | I have developed nicehash score calculation by querying coingecko, grinmint and nicehash apis. calculation algorithm is based on @joltz repo. I tested script and validated that results are same with https://joltz.keybase.pub/api/grin | I will implement script for reorg score calculation | ---- | No |
|23.01.2021 | stakervali | 4 | I have fixed a bug in reorg_parser. I have implemented reorg_score calculation based on @joltz repo | I will store results of nicehash and reorg score  into database with a new table| ---| No|
|24.01.2021 | stakervali | 4 | I have created sql script for health_score table in db. I have developed health_check script as command line utilty. I have updated readme.md with health_check section. | Deployment of scripts to production. Addition of Geomap for grinnodes in frontend | ---- | No|
|31.01.2021 | stakervali | 1 | I have added health, nicehash and reorg score ro statistics page. I fetch joltz API but got CORS error due to missing 'access-control-allow-origin' header. | I will  fetch nicehash and grinming api from client for nicehash calculation. | I could not fetch joltz's API as planned | No |
|1.01.2021| stakervali | 2| I have implemented nicehash calculation logic in vue-frontend. | Nicehash api calls must be done from backend. I will test it after python script's deployment. | Nicehash api does not add Cross Origin and returns 403 response. I have tried crossorigin.me to proxy api call and it failed with 403 response too. | No|
|12.02.2021| stakervali| 3| I have examined summary logs and extract depth count and deepest branch values for calculation of reorg score. I did some explatory data analysis | I will work on grinnode-backend for parser integration | ---| No|
|14.02.2021| stakervali| 6| I have worked on accessing Wallet API to check donation wallet of grinnode.live. Based on bladedoyle's help we checked wallet via curl command. | I will work on adding wallet health-check feature on backend. |--- |No|
|16.02.2021| stakervali| 3| I have cloned backend api code on my local computer and setup. Mainly I tried to overcome an authorization problem in sql connection. I have managed to run application | I will get familiar on code and integrate health score query to API | --- | No|
|17.02.2021| stakervali| 5 | I have studied existing code and application logic. I have added healthscore as a route and add sql query to api_controller and cache sections. I have setup health_check and parser setup script to feed database and query database on backend api controller and ran succesfully. I have fixed some bugs on health_checker script. | I will look into  healthscore last updatetime issue. I will deploy backend to a remote server for testing and adding donation-wallet health check.| Backend api reports healthscore check time shifted-incorrectly. python script saves time to database in utc timezone.Backend converts it to wrong timezone  | No |
|23.02.2021| stakervali| 5 | I have converted logging dates for reorg parser and health checker to utc timestamps (integer) in database. I have converted python scripts and queries in backend accordingly. I have setup a test server and deployed both python scripts and backend. |  I will work on donation wallet check in backend | --- | No |
|24.02.2021| stakervali| 6 | Test server crashed due to cpu spike, I have fixed it wrapping main script function with a daemon thread. I have added pid logging for following/killing script process. I have implementd donation-wallet-health check in backend api and deployed to test server. |  I will work on presentation of health check in frontend and continue testing the script. | --- | No |
|26.02.2021| stakervali| 6| I have removed verbose print statement and implement logging in parser, sample-generator and health-checker scripts. I have added max_depth option to sample generator for better testing. I have switch back to normal threads from daemon and fixed time issue by removing file-time argument. I have searched for a charting library with small size and decided to use flot library. I have start working on frontend for consuming and presentation of health-score endpoint | I will continue working on frontend and testing | --- | No | 
|1.03.2021| stakervali| 8| I have worked on integration of health-score to frontend. I converted date to more human readable format. Added health check to vue-$dao which  queries test-server like other api endpoints. I have discarded flot because of jquery dependence. I have integrated chartist.js, I have added option to interactively plot reorg, nicehash and overall health scores. | I will work on testing frontend. I will work on tor address check to faq page, existing links are not working. | --- | No|
|2.03.2021| stakervali| 5 | I have added custom wallet check as an endpoint to API and deployed to test-server. I have added an input form in the frontend stat page for checking validity of wallet via this endpoint. I have done some research for world map visualization of grinnode count per country. I have found that d3.js is simplest approach. I have checked script logs in the test-server.| I will complete world map visualization of nodes and clean up code for deployment. | ---- | No |
