CPU spikes every 30 minutes due to mysql process.   | I will continue on testing... |  tor address check stucks if one checks one address after another, I will fix it | Yes |
|16.03.2021| stakervali| 6| I have fixed tor address check. When ordinary urls entered, wallet check stucked, fixed. Adjusted frontend due to changes in API for health score endpoint. Fixed some alignment issues, edited chart ppadding for better view in mobile. Edited health text description. I tested cpu usage without scripts running and also tested with current master branch in order to find out if the additions I made in backend caused it.
